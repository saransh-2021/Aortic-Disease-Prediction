# Aortic-Disease-Prediction
---

Problem Statement : Despite the advancements in medical imaging and diagnostic techniques, the early detection and prediction of Aortic diseases remain challenging. The utilization of machine learning algorithms presents an opportunity to enhance predictive models using the Statlog dataset. However, developing accurate and reliable machine learning models for Aortic Disease Prediction requires addressing various challenges such as data heterogeneity, feature selection, and model interpretability. This project aims to explore and overcome these challenges to develop a robust and clinically relevant predictive model for Aortic diseases using the Statlog dataset.

The project, created by **Saransh Shukla** , aimed to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Develop a system capable of performing binary classification to determine the absence (1) or presence (2) of heart disease. The dataset used for this purpose can be found at this link: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Heart%29).
2. Evaluate the performance of five different classification algorithms - Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Naiive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). The evaluation metrics used were accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC curve.
